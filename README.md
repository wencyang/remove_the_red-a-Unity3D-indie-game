# remove_the_red-an_Unity3D_game

This is my first game made with Unity3D and C#, which was published to Apple App Store years ago. I think It's kind of an interesting and fun game where you drag a stick out from a pile of sticks. And it may be a good idea to share this project with many indie gamers and game making beginners.
